# coursera-git-n-github
In this repository I'm learning how to interact with GitHub by passing "Introduction to Git and GitHub course" by Google on Coursera.org

This repo will be populated with lots of fancy checks!

Now I'm passing my third week exam on coursera! This line proofs that I can edit files and push them on remote repo :)Ã
